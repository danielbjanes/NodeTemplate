# NodeTemplate
Starter node template to get react files up an running. I wanted to have some code pre built so when starting a new project I could quickly get a template running. This has been designed to be super easy to use and start developing from

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Language
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Server
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) - Runner

After getting those installed simply clone this git repo.
In the root directory ("/NodeTemplate") in your terminal just type `yarn`. This should install all of the node dependencies automatically.

From there to get the server running type `yarn start` into the terminal and connect to `localhost:8080`.

Enjoy!
